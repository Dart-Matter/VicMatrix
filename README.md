Yet another digital rain demo.  I wrote this to better visualize the fading and layering dimensions.

For VIC-20, Commodore 64, Commodore 128 (native mode), and Commodore 16 / Plus4.

Assemble with the ACME assembler (see BUILD.TXT)

To start, load the program and run it the same way as a BASIC program.

  LOAD"MATRIXxxx"
  ...
  RUN

Press RUN/STOP to reset the computer.
